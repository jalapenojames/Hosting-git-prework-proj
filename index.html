<!-- This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, 
so it is important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into 
the project in some way. For example, you could use a mouseover event to 
change the appearance of an element when the user mouses over it. Or use a 
click event to toggle some content between being visible and hidden. There 
are a variety of ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned 
so far, but don't forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google 
is an invaluable tool for developers! Try to use this project as an opportunity 
to stretch your coding skills!

The content, styling, and functionality of your site are up to you. Keep 
in mind that you may show this project to your peers and future instructors, 
so be considerate of content/subject matter and your potential audience. -->
